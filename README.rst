Clive is a hive mind for your clusters. But what the hell does that
mean? Well, clive is intended to be a suite of pluggable tools which
integrate together nicely to help you manage groups of servers.

The first component of clive is the PoD system. A "pod" is simply a
piece of data; specifically metadata about a host or set of
hosts. PoDs are scripts written in the language of your choice that
output JSON. Clive loads these pods on the fly to output
(JSON-formatted) information about a given host.

For now that is all, but there is definitely more to come!
